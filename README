Prima extension for OpenGL drawing.

Works on win32 and x11, under cygwin works in x11 mode only ( possibly
in win32 mode too, but I couldn't compile OpenGL under cygwin so it uses
win32 API).

Howto:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make 
    make test
    make install
    perl examples/icosahedron.pl
